# Codebase Gap Analysis — decops

**Date:** 2026-05-13 (updated)
**Branch:** `feat/libp2p-toolkit`
**Scope:** Full audit of `src/` covering architecture, testing, types, performance, errors, theme, security, docs, jobs, and build.

---

## Executive Summary

The codebase has matured into a multi-toolkit workspace. **All original HIGH-severity items are now resolved** across phases 1–5. Remaining work is MEDIUM/LOW — quality polish (more tests, theme cleanup, per-command timeouts, error utility, audit logs, a11y) and CI hygiene.

### Progress Snapshot

| Metric | Original | Current | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `: any` / `as any` in `src/hooks` + `src/services` | 294 | **12** | −282 (−96%) |
| Test files | 34 | **47** | +13 |
| Total tests passing | n/a | **474/474** | — |
| Silent `catch {}` blocks | 18 | **12** | −6 |

### Severity Counts (Remaining Open)

| Severity | Original | Open |
|----------|----------|------|
| High     | 6        | **0** |
| Medium   | 9        | **3** |
| Low      | 5        | **2** |

## 1. Architectural Inconsistencies

### 1.1 Toolkit Registration Patterns Diverge — **HIGH (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commit `c9b20fc`.
- New `src/toolkits/index.ts` is the single boot entry point. It imports
  bot delegations (`studioBot`, `libp2pBot`) and UI `register.ts` modules
  in deterministic order, and exports `useToolkitChatAgents()` for
  hook-based chat-agent registration.
- `main.tsx` now does a single `import "@/toolkits"` instead of six
  scattered side-effect imports.
- `CommandContextProvider` uses `useToolkitChatAgents()`; the
  libp2p-specific `useRegisterLibp2pChatAgent` hook was deleted.
- Adding a new toolkit is now a one-line change in `@/toolkits/index.ts`,
  eliminating HMR / double-registration risk.

### 1.2 Bot Bypass of Shared Pipeline — **HIGH (RESOLVED)**
- libp2p flows through `streamChatWithWorkspace` (commit `021e048`).
- **Audit completed:** `studioBot.ts` registers a `ChatDelegation` (no `onSubmit` bypass); `editor` toolkit ships no chat bot at all (only provider + view). The only remaining `onSubmit` reference in the toolkits is `Libp2pBotModal.tsx`, which is a form-submit handler, not a chat dispatcher. No further bypass paths exist.

### 1.3 Two Workspace Context Sources — **MEDIUM (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commit `3d1cf47` — `CommandContext.workspace` now exposes `getAgents() / getChannels() / getGroups() / getMessages()` live getters so commands always read fresh state during async multi-step jobs. Snapshot arrays still present for sync read sites.
- **Follow-up complete:** migrated all sync-snapshot callers in `agent.ts` (`ping_agent`), `toolkit.ts` (`list_agent_toolkits`), `query.ts` (`list_agents` / `list_groups` / `list_channels` / `list_messages`), `group.ts` (consensus-channel auto-creation), and `topology.ts` (`create_bridge` resolvers + `print_topology`) onto the live getters with snapshot fallback. `messaging.ts` was already migrated.

---

## 2. Testing Gaps

### 2.1 Critical Runtime Paths — **RESOLVED**
- **Resolved (commit `2eae8db`):** added coverage for `src/services/ai/runner.ts` (`runChatTurn`), `src/services/ai/delegation.ts`, and `src/services/ai/streaming.ts` smoke paths.
- **Resolved (commit `8ecd7d6` + `32d6288`):** `jobScheduler` atomic-reservation and slot-release lifecycle covered by 17 tests; invariants proven under normal completion, early return, sync throw, async rejection, and out-of-order completion.
- **Resolved (executor.test.ts, 16 tests against `runJob`):** serial/parallel/mixed modes, output mappings, $storage / $deliverable / $input refs, onStep callbacks, continueOnFailure, haltAfterSuccess, deliverable assembly.
- **Resolved (`8368c6f` bots.integration.test.ts, 17 tests):** status/config/log accessors for `libp2pBot` + `studioBot`, plus `analyzeLayout` (overlap / orphan / cramped detection, serial chain length, max parallel width, canvas extent).
- **Resolved (useJobExecutor.integration.test.tsx, 4 tests):** queued → running → completed effect flow, failure path with addNotebookEntry "Job Failed" emission, prompt-input pause routing through `updateJob({status:"awaiting-input"})` (and skipping `registry.execute`), and `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` enforcement under saturated queues.
- **Target met:** combined headless `runJob` + scheduler + React hook integration coverage exceeds 60 % on `src/services/ai/` and `src/hooks/useJobExecutor.tsx`.

### 2.2 No E2E / Integration Tests for Chat UI — **RESOLVED**
- `ChatPanel.tsx` (~1000 LOC) previously had no automated coverage of the submit pipeline (free text, slash commands, send button gating).
- **Resolved (ChatPanel.integration.test.tsx, 9 tests):** stable `data-testid` hooks added (`chat-panel-input`, `chat-panel-send`, `chat-panel-stop`, `chat-panel-messages`); React Testing Library + Vitest jsdom integration tests cover: input/send rendering, empty-input send disabled, send-enabled after typing, free-text Enter submit (renders user message + invokes `streamChatWithWorkspace` + renders assistant reply), send-button click parity, unknown slash command (renders ❌ Unknown command, no LLM call), known no-args slash command (`jobs.addJob` called with correct `type` + `steps[0].commandId`, conversation shows "queued as a job"), `addLog` invocation, and whitespace-only input rejected. `Element.prototype.scrollIntoView` polyfilled in `src/test/setup.ts` for jsdom.
- **Scope note:** RTL integration in Vitest chosen over Playwright/Cypress; covers the routing logic in the React submit path. Browser-level E2E (real LLM streaming over the network, tool-call rendering, multi-turn) remains a separate workstream if real browser fidelity is needed.

---

## 3. Type Safety Gaps — **MEDIUM (DOWNGRADED FROM HIGH)**

### 3.1 `any` Proliferation — **RESOLVED**
- **Current count:** **3** raw `: any` matches in `src/hooks` + `src/services` (was 294; −291, −99 %). Toolkit TypeScript is at **0** explicit `any` matches; the remaining toolkit grep hits are CSS `overflow-wrap: anywhere` false positives.
- **Resolved hot spots:**
  - `src/hooks/useJobExecutor.tsx` — `jobs`, `addJob`, `updateJobStatus`, etc. now use derived `UseJobsReturn[...]` types (commit `6e725e5`).
  - `src/services/commands/tools.ts`, `runner.ts`, `streaming.ts` — most `any` → `unknown` with proper narrowing (commit `3e42bce`).
  - `src/services/commands/registry.ts`, `dryRun.ts`, `jobRuntime.ts` — local helpers, accumulators, and entity lookups tightened (commits `95d7fab`, `5102edb`, `96acff5`).
  - `src/services/commands/types.ts` — `CommandContext` workspace/ecosystem/jobs/auth now use real types (commit `b3c7715`).
  - §3.1 continuation commits through `3bc16d4` reduced `src/hooks` + `src/services` to intentional boundary matches and cleared explicit `any` from toolkit TypeScript.
  - `955b90c` tightened `CommandArg.validation` from `(value: any)` to `(value: unknown)` and narrowed all command-definition validators with `typeof` guards.
  - `7b18a2c` tightened `registry.ts` (resolveEntityName, execute, dryRun, dryRunJob) and `dryRun.ts` (getEntityCollection, dryRunCommand, dryRunJob) from `context: any` to `context: CommandContext`; removed 7 `eslint-disable` directives. Test fixtures use `as CommandContext` cast.
  - `7b18a2c` reworded `planner.ts` prose to drop the grep false positive.
- **Remaining intentional matches: 0.** Previous 3 boundary `any`s in `src/hooks/useCommandContext.ts` (`jobs`, `ecosystem`, `architect` props) eliminated in the deferred §3.1 follow-up:
  - Introduced narrow input aliases `JobsInput = UseJobsReturn & { savedJobs?; saveJob?; deleteJob? }`, `EcosystemInput = Partial<UseEcosystemReturn>`, and `ArchitectInput = { generateNetwork(prompt): void | Promise<void>; deployNetwork(): void | Promise<void> }`. Optional ecosystem fields receive no-op / empty defaults inside the hook body so the ChatPanel lite fallback (`{ networks: [], bridges: [] }`) still satisfies the contract.
  - Discarded the architect impl's Promise to keep `CommandContext.architect.{generateNetwork,deployNetwork}: () => void` invariant (`(p) => { void architect.generateNetwork(p); }`).
  - `JobArtifact.type` narrowed via documented `as JobArtifact["type"]` cast inside `addDeliverable` (CommandContext exposes `string` ergonomically; storage demands `ArtifactType` literal).
  - `CommandContextProvider` re-exported `EcosystemInput` / `ArchitectInput`; `ChatPanel.ecosystem?: EcosystemInput` replaces the ad-hoc `{ networks?: …[]; [key: string]: unknown }` shape that had a latent Network-shape mismatch.
  - `src/test/hooks/useCommandContext.test.ts` fixtures expanded with full `UseJobsReturn` surface and cast through the hook's parameter type.

### 3.2 Missing Discriminated Unions for Job States — **RESOLVED**
- **Fixed in:** commit `e386ea3` — `Job` is now a discriminated union on `status`:
  - `queued | running` (no terminal data)
  - `awaiting-input` (carries required `pendingPrompt`)
  - `completed | failed` (carry required `completedAt`, optional `result`)
- Terminal-only and prompt-only fields are excluded from non-matching variants so consumers must narrow on `status` before access.

---

## 4. Performance & Concurrency Gaps

### 4.1 Job Executor Race Conditions — **HIGH (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commits `8ecd7d6` and `32d6288`.
- Atomic `reserveBatch()` selector + reservation in `src/hooks/jobScheduler.ts` guarantees `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` is never exceeded across rapid effect re-runs.
- `useJobExecutor.tsx` slot-release now relies exclusively on the IIFE's `finally` block (redundant explicit `processingRef.delete()` calls removed).
- 17 scheduler tests cover normal completion, early return, sync/async errors, out-of-order completion, and the 20-job soak invariant.

### 4.2 Latency Fixes Applied — **DONE** (commit `021e048`)

### 4.3 Remaining Polling Fallback — **DONE** (commit `af2628e`)
- 1 s `setInterval(processJobs, 1000)` fallback removed from `useJobExecutor`. State-driven invocation via the effect dep on `jobs` covers every queueing path (`addJob`, `resolvePromptInput`, `updateJob({status:"queued"})`).

### 4.4 Topology Retry Loop — **DONE** (commit `ac3891a`)
- `resolveSpecWithRetry` now uses exponential backoff (50 → 100 → 200 → 400 → 800 → 1000 cap) with a 5 s total budget instead of 30 × 500 ms = 15 s fixed.

---

## 5. Error Handling Gaps

### 5.1 Silent `catch` Blocks — **MEDIUM (PARTIALLY ADDRESSED)**
- **Centralized `logError(context, err, data?, opts?)` utility shipped** in `src/services/logging/logError.ts` (commit `49d53b3`) — synchronous, never throws, normalises any thrown value, publishes to the global `LogAggregator` on the `errors` channel.
- Adopted in `src/toolkits/libp2p/service.ts` for `node.stop`, `manager.persist`, and `manager.removeNode.stop` failures that were previously hidden.
- **Remaining silent catches** in the tree (clipboard writes, `localStorage` quota, JSON parse fallbacks, snapshot serialisation, pubsub-unavailable probes) are intentionally silent — they are idiomatic fallbacks, not error swallows, and should stay that way.

### 5.2 Stream Error Channel Underused — **LOW (OPEN)**
- Verify all delegations route through `streamChatWithWorkspace`.

---

## 6. Theme / UI Consistency Gaps

### 6.1 Hardcoded Colors — **MEDIUM (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commit `515de6b`. 25 bare slate hex literals in `src/toolkits/libp2p/styles/libp2p.css` replaced with design-token `var(--…)` references that fall back gracefully across theme variants (`theme-light.css`, `theme-solar.css`).
- libp2p solar tabs/radio were already normalised in commit `021e048`.
- **Follow-up (LOW):** `src/toolkits/studio/styles/`, `src/toolkits/editor/styles/` still contain a few literal greys; replace opportunistically when those areas are touched.

### 6.2 Accessibility — **MEDIUM (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commit `7bc2c82`.
- New `useFocusTrap` hook (`src/hooks/useFocusTrap.ts`) traps Tab/Shift+Tab, focuses first focusable on mount, restores previously-focused element on unmount, and wires Escape to `onClose`.
- Applied to `Libp2pCollectionsModal`, `Libp2pNetworksModal`, `Libp2pBotModal` with `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"`.
- 50+ icon-only buttons in libp2p / studio / architect toolkits gained `aria-label` mirroring existing `title` attributes.
- 5 new hook tests cover Tab cycle, Shift+Tab wrap, Escape, inactive state, and initial focus.
- **Follow-up (LOW):** extend trap to remaining modals (`JobInputPromptModal`, `NodeEditModal`) and add an a11y lint rule.

---

## 7. Security Gaps

### 7.1 RBAC Enforcement — **HIGH (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commit `608aa7d`.
- `assertRBAC()` (in `src/services/commands/rbac.ts`) is invoked at the top of `CommandRegistry.execute()`.
- Throws typed `RBACDenied` (extends `Error`) carrying `commandId`, `actorRole`, and `allowedRoles` so the UI can detect via `instanceof` and render a permission-denied message.
- Defaults to `"orchestrator"` when `auth.user.role` is unset (preserves headless / single-user behaviour).
- Covered by `src/test/services/commands/rbac.test.ts`.

### 7.2 Identity Export Auditing — **MEDIUM (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commit `6fc1271`. Audit log entries are now appended via `workspace.addLog()` on every identity-export tool call (timestamp + node id + initiator).

### 7.3 XSS Risk in Editor — **MEDIUM (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commit `6fc1271`. Editor preview confirmed to use `react-markdown` with default safe rendering (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`); regression tests added covering raw-HTML and `javascript:` URL sanitization.

---

## 8. Documentation Gaps — **LOW (PARTIALLY RESOLVED)**

- ADRs 0001–0004 added under `docs/adr/` covering toolkit contract, chat-delegation, job lifecycle, and theme tokens.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` already exists and is current; deeper service-by-service doc is deferred.
- Sparse JSDoc in `src/services/ai/runner.ts`, `src/services/commands/tools.ts` remains — add as files are touched.

---

## 9. Job / Command System Gaps

### 9.1 Missing Tool Output Schemas — **MEDIUM (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed in:** commit `b637b9c`. All 89 `CommandDefinition` entries across 24 files now declare an `outputSchema` in JSON-Schema form (`{type:"object", properties:{…}}` or `{type:"object", additionalProperties:true}` for free-form returns).
- New coverage test (`src/test/services/commands/outputSchemaCoverage.test.ts`) iterates every built-in module and fails the build if any command is missing `outputSchema` or uses the legacy shorthand.

### 9.2 Command Timeout Inconsistency — **DONE** (commit `34165da`)
- `CommandDefinition` now carries optional `timeoutMs` and `spawnsChildJobs` fields.
- Tool-call adapter uses `resolveToolTimeout(name)` with order: explicit `timeoutMs` → `spawnsChildJobs` (180 s) → default (30 s).

### 9.3 `JOB_RUNNER_COMMANDS` Allowlist — **DONE** (commit `34165da`)
- Hardcoded allowlist deleted. `studio_run_job`, `studio_create_job`, and `deploy_network` now declare `spawnsChildJobs: true` on their definitions.

---

## 10. Dependency / Build Gaps — **LOW (RESOLVED)**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm run typecheck` (already `strict: true`), `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run size` on every push/PR. `ts-prune` runs as an advisory step (`continue-on-error: true`) since most flagged exports are re-exports / module-internal types.
- New npm scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`, `size`, `prune`.
- `.size-limit.cjs` resolves Vite's hashed entry assets from `dist/index.html` and enforces gzip budgets: main JS ≤ 450 KB (currently 419 KB), main CSS ≤ 95 KB (currently 86 KB).

---

## Updated Action Plan — Remaining Work

All HIGH-severity gaps are now resolved. Remaining items are MEDIUM/LOW.

### Phase 6 — Quality (remaining)
1. ~~[MEDIUM] Integration tests for `useJobExecutor` + bots (§2.1).~~ — **RESOLVED**
2. ~~[MEDIUM] E2E / integration smoke suite for `ChatPanel` (§2.2).~~ — **RESOLVED** (Vitest+RTL, 9 tests)

### Phase 7 — Low priority (remaining)
3. ~~[LOW] Continue opportunistic `any` cleanup — 3 remaining boundary matches in `src/hooks/useCommandContext.ts` (§3.1 deferred follow-up).~~ — **RESOLVED.** All 3 boundary `any`s replaced with narrow input aliases (`JobsInput`, `EcosystemInput`, `ArchitectInput`); cascading callers (`CommandContextProvider`, `ChatPanel`, test fixtures) updated.
